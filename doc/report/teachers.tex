\section{Interviews}
We considered some scenarios good for our tracking system and figured out that monitoring students' positions in school trips perfectly suited us. The primary need of our application is to ensure students' safety by providing support to teachers. It means alerting teachers if a child walks away from them.

\subsection{Teachers}
During our interview sessions with teachers, we aimed to gain insights into their requirements concerning school trips. Based on the feedback received, the following key aspects emerged:
\begin{itemize}
\item In most cases, classes consist of approximately 20-25 students, and usually, 2 teachers are assigned to each class. As a result, each teacher is responsible for monitoring approximately 15 students simultaneously.
\item Although missing students were infrequent, teachers expressed deep concern and fear when such incidents occurred.
\item The consensus among all interviewed teachers was that an application capable of alerting them in case of a missing student would be highly beneficial.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{User 1}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{On average, how many school trips do you participate in a year?}
\\ As a teacher in a lower secondary school, I typically participate in around three to four school trips per year.
\item \textbf{Have you made any this year? If yes, how did the last trip go?}
\\ Yes. The last school trip we had went smoothly, and the collaboration between the teachers helped maintain a safe and organized experience.
\item \textbf{How many teachers supervise the same group during a school trip?}
\\ During our school trips, we usually have a team of two teachers supervising the same group. This allows us to ensure proper supervision and manage the students effectively.
\item \textbf{What is the average number of pupils supervised on a school trip?}
\\ On average, we supervise a group of approximately twenty to twenty-five pupils during a school trip. This number allows us to maintain a manageable group size while ensuring adequate supervision and attention to each student.
\item \textbf{Have you ever felt that a group member was missing?}
\\ Fortunately, I haven't experienced a situation where I felt a group member was missing during a school trip. However, we always maintain a headcount and implement buddy systems to ensure the safety and presence of all students throughout the journey.
\item \textbf{Would you consider a practical application that warns you in real time if a member of the group leaves?}
\\ Absolutely, I would consider using a practical application that provides real-time alerts if a group member leaves the designated area during a school trip.
Such an application would significantly enhance our ability to monitor student safety and respond promptly to potential issues or concerns.

\item \textbf{Would you consider a practical application that warns you in real time if a member of the group leaves?}
\\ While the concept of a practical application that warns in real-time sounds useful, I have concerns about the potential privacy implications and the reliance on technology for supervision during school trips. Therefore, I would need more information and assurances about data security and privacy before deciding.
