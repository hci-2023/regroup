\subsection{Parents}
Most parents are apprehensive when their children have a school trip. Indeed even children without a mobile phone are provided one by their parents for this particular activity. We noticed that this concern grows up as the age of children decreases, assuming that an older student is more responsible. Almost every parent would feel safer if there was a mobile application warning the teachers in case of children missing. Moreover, most parents are OK with sharing their children's credentials even though they prefer not to include pictures.
