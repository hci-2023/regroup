\section{Our Goal}
The primary goal of our mobile application is to empower teachers to monitor their students using Bluetooth technology. By prioritizing student safety and data privacy, our application will deliver the following functionalities:
\begin{itemize}
\item A \emph{user-friendly} registration process requiring only a username for quick access.
\item \emph{Real-time} notifications are sent to the teacher's device whenever a student strays beyond a predefined distance from the teacher or the group.
\item Implementing a \emph{secure} and \emph{private} system for storing and handling student location data, eliminating the need for GPS technology.
\end{itemize}
